# MHS-MXP

Title: Abductive reasoner for description logics combining MHS and MXP

Annotation: Abductive reasoning is a novel and non-standard reasoning technique in the area
of description logics. Several abductive reasoners have been developed. Some
are complete, e.g. based on the Minimal Hitting Set (MHS) algorithm. Some
are fast but incomplete, e.g. based on the MergeXplain (MXP) algorithm.

Aim: The goal is to implement and empirically evaluate a combined abductive
reasoner based on integration of the MHS and MXP algorithms.
